# PacMan

## The PacMan Exercise

In this project we learned DOM Manipulation through Javascript techniques to inject code into the HTML page as elements.
The HTML was injected dynamically to make an animation of multiple PacMan images float and bounce around the page with
random movements. 

## RoadMap:
-Add Chomping and Turning Feature of PacMan Figures
-Add Images of Goombas
-Make Images more accurate to the classic PacMan game

## Licensing
This is an official project by MIT x Emeritus
