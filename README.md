# PacMan

## The PacMan Exercise

In this project we learned DOM Manipulation through Javascript techniques to inject code into the HTML page as elements.
The HTML was injected dynamically to make an animation of multiple PacMan images float and bounce around the page with
random movements. 

## How to Run:
The script is run by first pressing the "Add PacMan" button to add as many PacMan figures as you'd like, and thereafter
pressing the "Start Game" button to activate motion. 

## RoadMap:
-Add Chomping and Turning Feature of PacMan Figures
-Add Images of Goombas
-Make Images more accurate to the classic PacMan game
